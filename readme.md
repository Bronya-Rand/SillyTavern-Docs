# What is SillyTavern?

![SillyTavern - LLM Frontend for Power Users](https://docs.sillytavern.app/static/banner.jpg)

Brought to you by Cohee, RossAscends, and the SillyTavern community, SillyTavern is a local-install interface that allows you to interact with text generation AIs (LLMs) to chat and roleplay with custom characters.

SillyTavern originated as a modification of TavernAI 1.2.8 in February 2023, and has since added many cutting-edge features not present in the original TavernAI.

### Missing extensions after the update?

Since the 1.10.6 release version, most of the previously built-in extensions have been converted to downloadable add-ons. You can download them via the built-in "Download Extensions and Assets" menu in the extensions panel (stacked blocks icon in the top bar).
