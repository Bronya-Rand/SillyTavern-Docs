# OpenRouter

Don't have access to OpenAI / Claude APIs due to geolocking or waitlists? Use OpenRouter.

OpenRouter works by letting you use keys they own to access models like GPT-4 and Claude 2, all in one service with a shared credit pool.

It has a free trial (about $1) and paid access afterward.  No subscription or monthly bill - you pay for what you actually use. Some models have free access with a limited context size.
