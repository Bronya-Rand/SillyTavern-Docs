# Prompt Manager

The Prompt Manager is a system that allows for more control over the [prompt-building](prompts.md) strategy for Chat Completion APIs.

!!! Applies to: Chat Completion APIs
For equivalent settings in Text Completion APIs, use [Advanced Formatting](advancedformatting.md).
!!!

!!! Naming Prompt Manager Presets
Please bear in mind that if a preset shares a name with one of your character cards, it will get automatically selected when starting a chat with that particular character. Name presets something unique to avoid this behaviour. 
!!!

Access Prompt Manager by clicking on the "AI Response Configuration" button in the navigation bar. Prompt manager is below the [common settings](/Usage/Common-Settings.md) panel.
