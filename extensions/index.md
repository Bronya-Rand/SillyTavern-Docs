SillyTavern comes with many extensions that can be enabled or disabled in the Extensions panel. Extensions can add new features, change the behaviour of existing features, or provide additional content for your AI to use.

Some of the extensions include:

* [Character emotional expressions (sprites)](/extensions/Expression-Images.md)
* [Auto-Summary of the chat history](/extensions/Summarize.md)
* Automatic UI and chat translation
* [Stable Diffusion/FLUX/DALL-E image generation](/extensions/Stable-Diffusion.md)
* [Text-to-speech for AI response messages (via ElevenLabs, Silero, or the OS's System TTS)](/extensions/TTS.md)
* [Web Search capabilities for adding additional real world context to your prompts](/extensions/WebSearch.md)

Many more are available to download from the "Download Extensions & Assets" menu.
